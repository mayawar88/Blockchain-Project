# Blockchain for Secure EHRs Sharing of Mobile Cloud Based E-Health Systems **

## Executing the Project:
- To run project first double click on ‘run.bat’ file from ‘Node1’ folder to start Blockchain node1 and to get below screen.

- In above screen Blockchain node1 started and now double click on ‘run.bat’ from Node2 folder to start Blockchain node2 application and to get below screen

- In above screen node2 Blockchain started and now double click on ‘run.bat’ file from ‘BlockchainSecret’ folder to get below screen

- In above screen enter some block data and I am taking paper example as ‘19270415’ as block data and sharing between 4 peoples or nodes but I am sharing between two nodes. 
  In above paper example author using block data as 19270415 and sharing between 4 peoples

- In above screen I entered same number and that number will share with two nodes as SHAMIR secret and now click on ‘Share Blocks’ button to get below screen

  ![p5](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/104061649/185744559-2b3cfec7-e842-46af-a273-4e1eceb8b21a.jpg)

- In above screen we can see the block data ‘19270415’ is converted to length share values and then that length decimal values share between two node and below is the block chain nodes screen

- In above screen two nodes received share data and we can see current hash value of block 0 is matched with previous hash value of block 1 in both nodes and this make   Blockchain to consider as successful verification. In above screen we can see instead of given input as ‘19270415’ we got SHAMIR secret which will not understand by   any one and to recover that data back just give the block number and then application obtained share values from all nodes and reconstruct original value. Now in       below screen I will enter block number 1 to get original data back

- In above screen I gave input as block number 1 and then click on ‘Retrieve & Reconstruct Block’ button to get original data back

- In above screen we can see we collected share from both nodes and from that shares we reconstruct original values as ‘19270415’


  Similarly you can enter any values and send to Blockchain as blocks and then by entering block number you can get original block value back. Now click on ‘Storage     Graph’ button to get below storage graph
